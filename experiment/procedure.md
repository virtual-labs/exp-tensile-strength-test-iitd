### These steps will be followed for the experiment

**Preparation of specimens:**

1. Specimens when received dry shall be kept in water for 48 hours before they are taken for testing. Specimen shall be tested immediately on removal from the water whilst they are still wet. Surface water and grit shall be wiped off the specimens and any projecting fins removed from the surfaces which are to be in contact with the packing strips.


**Marking**

2. Central lines shall be drawn on the two opposite faces. Ensure that they are in the same axial plane.


**Measurement**

3. The mass and dimensions of the specimen shall be noted before testing.

4. The length of the specimen shall be taken to the nearest 0.2 mm by averaging the two lengths measured in the plane containing the pre-marked lines.


**Positioning**

5. The bearing surfaces of the testing machine and of the loading strips shall be wiped clean before positioning the specimen.

6. The test specimen shall be placed in the centering jig with packing strip and/or loading pieces carefully positioning along the top and bottom of the plane of loading of the specimen. The jig shall then be placed in the machine so that the specimen is located centrally. For cylindrical specimen it shall be ensured that the upper platen is parallel with the lower platen.


**Rate of Loading**

7. The load shall be applied without shock and increased continuously at a nominal rate within the range 1.2 N/(mm<sup>2</sup>/min) to 2.4 N/ (mm<sup>2</sup>/min).


**Failure load**

8. The maximum load applied shall then be recorded.


**Assessment of type of fracture:**

The fractured specimen shall be examined and the appearance of the concrete and type of fracture, if unusual, shall be recorded. Satisfactory type of fracture is when the specimen is tested horizontally, and the plane of fracture is vertical.<br><br>

**Observations and Calculation:**

The measured splitting tensile strength f<sub>c</sub>, of the specimen shall be calculated to the nearest 0.05 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.

**Precautions:**

1. Verify that the samples do not have any significant defects that may affect the quality of the test results.

2. Use a straight-edge and square to draw a line parallel to the sample axis on the circumferential face of the sample.
